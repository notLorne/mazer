//The scene could be the block that brings every graphical and logical stuff together without actually 
//dealing with the gameplay.
//Maze could be contained here. Since the mazi is here, the collision zones should be here too. and the painting
//could be then made on the collision zones that would drive the entire logic of walking around.
// the scene would also have all the design elements then.
