for each actors,
create a mapX, mapY
to know where they are in the map
this is then calculated on the little map

each mapSpace is 256, 192

256 = zoomLevel(4) * 4 tiles * 32px
192 = zoomLevel(4) * 4 tiles * 24px

so a 20 x 20 = 128 * 20

so if start = 10,9

up,right corner => 320, 216

no.

at no zoom level to start, it is confusing.

one mapSpace = 128px x 96px

a 20 x 20 map =>

2560 x 1920

if start is at mapSpace (10,9);

mapSpace =>

x1 = 10 x 128 = 1280
y1 = 9  x  96 =  864

oh, how about we use another grid huh?
but based on the current mapSpace.

that grid would be like i dont know... 7 x 7 around player position
or it could be dynamic. depending on zoom level.

so if player is at 10, 9 :

28 x 28 grid.
so

the loop would start at 10 +/- 3 and 9 +/- 3
